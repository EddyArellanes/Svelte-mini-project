# Svelte mini project

Here I used almost all common concepts of Svelte, components, props, store, reactive, rollup, etc.

# Installation and run locally

`npm i`
`npm run dev`

- [x] Use of reactive, props, components
- [x] Use of update, suscribe of store
- [x] Use of env variables in rollup.config
- [x] Connect to API and iterate the objects
- [ ] Use of some router to make large apps
